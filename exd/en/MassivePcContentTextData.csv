1354,"Construction on the habitation modules is set to begin shortly! If you've been daydreaming about honest-to-goodness housing, your time is nigh!"
1355,"Excellent news for those of you roughing it on the cold, hard ground─the habitation modules are complete!
Thank you all for your support! The ruins will serve nicely as our base... I daresay Oizys is feeling homier already!
If you'd prefer a more detailed account, fear not! Reportingway and the Infrastructure Index are on the case."
1356,We're devising a central Cosmoliner concept─but the best-laid plans of Loporrit and man require materials and stellar missions!
1357,"You supplied *and* demanded it, so the central Cosmoliner construction is underway! Your patience until its completion is much appreciated."
1358,"Stop on by the central Cosmoliner circuit, because it's ready for action!
Travel around the base should no longer pose an issue...and for those inquiring about more stations, yes! We hear you!
Reportingway has archived our latest feat in the Infrastructure Index, so don't hesitate to give it a read!"
1359,"Our vital infrastructure won't materialize from nowhere! If you crave rechargeable exotablets and potable water, why not aid our supply efforts with stellar missions?"
1360,Do *you* thirst for power? Then I've got great news─energization station construction shall soon begin! Hop over and help us out when the time comes!
1361,"Say good-bye to candlelight and dead exotablets─the energization station is complete! Thanks to you all, power outages here will be a thing of the past!
With a means to convert environmental aether into energy, we'll have enough to permanently power the base!
Next, we set our sights on another much-needed resource: the hydrofication station! But for now, the newest Infrastructure Index entry is available for your perusal!"
1362,"Let there be water─the hydrofication station is complete, thanks to your collective efforts!
With your help, we've also established a nearby lab for Dylise! We implore you to drop by with any Oizys-related inquiries you might have!
If you missed out on construction, worry not! Reportingway has composed a rousing summary in the Infrastructure Index."
1363,"Within the floating rock formations to the southeast lie unknown minerals and potential keys to unlocking Oizys's secrets!
By manipulating the star's anomalous gravity and stabilizing the stones from the Unmoored Anchor, we could forge a floating bridge to guide us to Shadefleet!
Now, if we want to make *any* of that a reality, we'll need your supplies and support, so I hope you're ready for some stellar missions!"
1364,"Gravitational generator construction is nearly ready to begin! Join us, and help defy the laws of physics beyond reasoning! Yes, you heard that right!"
1365,"Our gravitational generators are complete, and with them, the buoyant bridge to Shadefleet!
Detailed surveys of the region are bound to give us additional insight on Oizys's gravitational anomalies.
If you wish to further appreciate the project's resounding success, Reportingway has composed a thrilling synopsis for the Infrastructure Index!"
1366,"We're conceptualizing a Cosmoliner extension to Shadefleet! With your─yes, *your*─stellar mission contributions, anything is possible!"
1367,"It's happening, fellow colleagues! The Cosmoliner extension to Shadefleet is underway as we speak! I'll alert you all as soon as it's completed!"
1368,"From here on out, we'll be zipping through Shadefleet in style─the Cosmoliner extension is complete!
On behalf of those who can now pursue more efficient surveys on the area, I thank all contributors for their efforts!
And remember: if you happened to miss out on the action, Reportingway has once again immortalized our progress in the Infrastructure Index!"
1369,"Our researchers hypothesize that the broken crystalline apparatus at Terra Firma─the Euhedron, it's called─was once a grand computing device!
Were we to reactivate it, we could uncover crucial knowledge on the star's previous residents! Thus, we plan to restore it along with the base!
Restoration will be no easy feat, and we'll need as many supplies as we can muster...but I am confident you are all up to the task!"
1370,"We shall soon be performing essential maintenance on Terra Firma to connect our energization stations to the base!
We'll have much to do when work begins in earnest, so hop on over if you've the time!"
1371,"Thanks to everyone's *firm* belief in our vision, Terra Firma's renewal is complete! We must now focus our efforts on full restoration of the Euhedron.
Access to its records would allow us a window into Oizys's distant past... Oooh, just imagining the possibilities has me hopping for joy!
...Ahem! Anyroad, Reportingway has added yet another entry to the Infrastructure Index. You won't want to miss it!"
1372,"Here's an Oizys fact for you─were you aware that the Euhedron crystal is exceedingly rare and found only on this star?
Unfortunately, its once-sparkling surfaces have dulled with the passage of time...to recover its crystalline gleam, we'll need to infuse it with plenty of aether!
Your stellar mission contributions will be key to these next steps, so we'll be counting on you all!"
1373,"Have you an appreciation for massive, luminous crystalline structures from a bygone age? If you answered “yes,” then have we got the project for you!
The Euhedron restoration is set to begin shortly! Crystal enthusiasts, we need you now more than ever!"
1374,"My word, look at that shine! The Euhedron restoration is complete! Our researchers can now begin a thorough analysis of its systems.
Alas, we'll require a good deal of time and effort for it to fully function again... But the data that rests within will be worth the wait, I'm sure!
To whet your appetite for delightful, delicious data until then, Reportingway has plenty to share in the Infrastructure Index!"
1375,"With such a wealth of relics and rare minerals to ship to Etheirys for analysis, we're going to need a bigger cosmoport!
You know the drill─supplies and stellar missions will be paramount to our success!"
1376,"We've ironed out our cosmoport renovation plans, so expect construction to begin soon! If you're eager to start building, stay tuned for further instructions!"
1377,"Ah, I love the smell of a freshly remodeled cosmoport! With renovations complete, we can now ship additional goods to Etheirys for research!
Of course, more research means more discoveries regarding those that came before us on Oizys. Oh, the things we might learn!
I'm also getting word we have a lovely new entry in the Infrastructure Index ready to pore over, courtesy of Reportingway. Huzzah!"
1378,"Subterranean ruins have been discovered in Emerald Echoes! If they're well-preserved, this could be a monumental discovery!
Excavation plans are underway as we speak, but the research team will require all the stellar mission contributions they can get!"
1379,"The Emerald Echoes excavation project shall soon commence!
If you aren't fazed by several tonzes of intergalactic dirt, come join us!"
1380,"Emerald Echoes update─a possible entrance to the ruin has been found! Dylise is investigating further.
Keen to learn more? Reportingway has authored a detailed report for the Infrastructure Index!"
1381,"The mystery of the sealed ruins door has been solved─the dim crystals flanking it are our keys to entry!
An analysis back home revealed that Oizys-sourced minerals could be used as catalysts to revitalize these crystals!
As you might expect, we'll need a surfeit of supplies for these next steps, so don't dally on those stellar missions!"
1382,"We'll soon be knocking on Emerald Echoes's door, and this time, we intend to get an answer! Come join us─it's only a hop away on the Cosmoliner!"
1383,"After much trial and error, the door to Emerald Echoes is open! What secrets lie beyond? Only one way to find out!
With the crystals' sheen also restored, our researchers are champing at the bit to scrutinize their every facet!
But for those who'd prefer *not* to stare agog at crystals, you can read Reportingway's new Infrastructure Index entry instead!"
1384,"Excellent news for the crystal appreciators out there─we've found another crystalline apparatus in the ruins!
Reactivating it could give us a better understanding of its original purpose, but such an undertaking will, of course, require stellar mission contributions!"
1385,"We'll soon be ready to breathe life back into the ruins' crystalline apparatus. If you've the paws to participate, come on down!"
1386,"A very good morning to the Guide Stone, awake after ages of slumber! With its technologies at our disposal, the ruins' depths are ours to explore!
Not only does this apparatus control the ruins, but our researchers posit that it may be linked to several bases across Oizys as well!
Reportingway's summed up our findings in the Infrastructure Index. I recommend you give it a gander!"
1387,"The crystalline terminal in the ruins' depths bears a striking resemblance to the Euhedron before its revitalization.
Based on our previous undertakings, we should have no trouble bringing this one back from the brink!
...Well, aside from the usual supplies, that is. Ready to aid us with some stellar missions, everyone?"
1388,"It's almost time to begin work on the apparatus at Emerald Echoes. Crystal connoisseurs, I know you're out there! We have need of you once more!"
1389,"It's alive! Alive, I tell you! The Metahedron looks good as new, and its information banks were perfectly preserved─a fortuitous development!
Expect plenty of new data in the coming days! This could potentially aid our progress with the Euhedron, as well...
For those who couldn't join us, don't fret! Reportingway's summarized this project in the Infrastructure Index!"
1390,Our engineers are presently dreaming up a subterranean Cosmoliner extension! Let's support them with stellar missions and keep those dreams alive!
1391,Wonderful news─your support for the subterranean Cosmoliner extension has enabled us to begin construction! We'll let you know the moment it's ready for traversal!
1392,"We're overjoyed to announce that the Cosmoliner now stretches underground to Emerald Echoes!
I see even more efficient analyses of the area in our future! Oooh, I do so love efficiency...
Speaking of, the newest entry of the Infrastructure Index is already complete and awaiting your perusal! Industrious as ever, that Reportingway!"
1393,"Attention, apparatus afficionados! I'm told that we may be able to utilize the Metahedron's aetheric information banks to restore the Euhedron!
Unlike our predecessors, however, we haven't the technology to synchronize these devices... At least, not *yet*!
So let's build a device that'll do just that! First, we must fortify Terra Firma to handle such a contraption... Stellar missions, anyone?"
1394,Construction on Terra Firma is nearly ready to commence! Enjoy the base in its current state while you can─it won't look like this much longer!
1395,"Huzzah! Terra Firma is now firmer than ever! With these extra enhancements, we're nearly set to build our aetheric resonance device!
Once we do, we'll be able to recover all manner of invaluable information from Emerald Echoes... We're closing in on a major breakthrough!
But before I get too carried away, I mustn't forget to mention Reportingway's newest Infrastructure Index entry! Let's give it a read, shall we?"
1396,"The time is come, everyone─our next goal is to construct the aetheric resonance device and reboot the Euhedron!
Countless ancient secrets sleep beneath those glimmering facets... And it's high time we uncovered them!
Oooh, I'm so excited, I feel like I might just hop through the atmosphere! ...But I mustn't! We've supplies to procure and stellar missions to undertake!"
1397,"This is it, my friends! We'll soon begin our efforts to reboot the Euhedron! We'll need everyone's help for this last push, so come join us when we're ready!"
1398,"Success, thy name is the Orthostat Tower! With its aetheric resonance network at the ready, I daresay the base is as complete as it'll ever be!
At long last, we'll be able to awaken the Euhedron's true potential! I extend my sincerest thanks to you all for your diligent efforts!
If you'd like to reflect on this grand achievement, Reportingway's newest Infrastructure Index entry awaits!"
1399,"It's been a long and gravitationally unstable road, but we've made incredible progress on Oizys! A hearty thank you to one and all for their contributions!
We of the initiative shall continue to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors... And I hope you'll be there to join us along the way!"
1400,Readings show the distortion values have fallen to half strength. Keep up the good work!
1401,Warning! A massive gravity sphere has manifested in the field!
1402,The primary distortion is weakening! Fluctuations in the gravity readings are beginning to even out!
1403,"The sphere has lost significant mass. One last concerted push, and it should dissipate entirely!"
1404,Well done! It appears the sphere has been dispersed.
1405,Collect as much floatstone as possible! Let's reach that quota!
1406,Keep at it! Every sphere you disperse weakens the effect of the distortions.
1407,Attention all personnel! Distortion values are spiking. Stay vigilant for new anomalies!
1408,The bubble bloom is predicted to abate shortly. Keep a steady pace and attend to your respective missions while conditions persist!
1409,"Thanks to the hard work of all our contributors, we have successfully secured a bounty of rare resources! The red alert has been lifted."
1410,"The bubble bloom is predicted to abate shortly. Although we did fall short of our ideal resource quota, your efforts are greatly appreciated! This red alert is no longer in effect. "
1411,We suspect this giant orb is the source of the anomaly. Focus every effort upon its immediate dissipation!
1412,Analyzing the composition of collected floatstones has allowed us to detect an immense deposit of the material in the skies above!
1413,Another gigantic floatstone has been detected!
1414,Maneuver your vacuum suit over the mech marker and activate its attractor beam!
1415,"A powerful gravitational anomaly has manifested at the Shielding Wall, causing field equipment to float into the air and interfere with our exploration efforts."
1416,"Portable gravity generators are proving effective at anchoring the equipment, but there is a shortage of available components. Contributions of generator parts are urgently requested. "
1417,We also have reports regarding another incident related to this anomaly.
1418,"The disruption has extended into Terra Firma itself, with a supply container floating skywards to such extreme altitudes that retrieval is no longer possible."
1419,"A large quantity of materials essential to rover maintenance has been lost as a result, and procuring replacements is now a top priority!"
1420,"Thanks to everyone's diligent efforts, we have secured sufficient maintenance materials. Reserve supplies are still being gratefully accepted on site."
1421,Our depository at the Shielding Wall has collected sufficient supplies to resolve the floating equipment issue. Your contributions are much appreciated!
1422,"Spheres of seawater have risen above Cape Geras, resulting in bubble bloom conditions and a dramatic surge in humidity across the entire region."
1423,"Following this occurrence, a grove of moisture-craving trees was observed rapidly sprouting at the Foregone Oasis. Lend a hand to help harvest this promising resource while the vegetation remains exposed aboveground!"
1424,The bubble bloom also presents us with an additional opportunity.
1425,A field researcher at the Sound Pole has reported the discovery of drifting bubbles containing metallic coral. It is theorized that the bloom phenomenon has lifted matter from the ocean deeps along with the seawater itself.
1426,Secure specimens of this metal-infused coral that we might further our studies into coastal environments and botanical distribution.
1427,We have collected sufficient specimens for further botanical studies. Any surplus samples will be gladly accepted at the Sound Pole depository.
1428,"The harvest at the Foregone Oasis has been plentiful! Thanks to your assistance, we have a bounty of this new resource to process and put to practical use."
1429,Gravitational fluctuations wreaking havoc with atmospheric pressure have given rise to gale-force winds! One such violent gust has overturned a rover carrying vital supplies.
1430,"The tempest has since spent its strength, so we ask for volunteers to make haste to the incident site to help restore order and replace the ruined stock of pananoodles!"
1431,We also have reports regarding another wind-related incident.
1432,A flight of drones carrying archaeological fragments has crash-landed in the pond east of the Megalithopolis after being buffeted by violent crosswinds.
1433,"We ask that workers hasten to the area to assist with retrieving fragments from the water, as well as contribute supplies for the delicate on-site restoration of muddied relics!"
1434,"The retrieval of relics from the pond east of the Megalithopolis is proceeding smoothly. Thanks to your diligent efforts, we expect the incident to be resolved without further issue."
1435,"We are still accepting surplus contributions, but the crisis involving the overturned rover and ruined pananoodles is otherwise resolved. Thank you for your swift action!"
1436,Gale-force winds arising from gravitationally agitated atmospheric pressures have caused a catastrophic rockfall in the south of the Long-lost Carrot!
1437,"With the howling gusts now easing off, we request assistance with removing the rocky debris. Skilled miners are also in demand to help extract a rare ore discovered in the chunks of fallen outcrop."
1438,We also have reports regarding another wind-related incident.
1439,"Workers on the Regolift have sustained serious injuries after the area was buffeted by the recent cyclonic gusts. Due to the scale of the incident, medicinal materials are running dangerously low."
1440,"On-site physicians warn that the wounded are still being brought in, and urgently request delivery of emergency treatment supplies!"
1441,The incident site now reports a generous surfeit of medical supplies. The physicians─and their patients─thank you for your timely deliveries.
1442,"Thanks to your enthusiastic cooperation, our rockfall crew has more than enough supplies to finish clearing the debris. We also thank our volunteer miners for procuring such copious quantities of rare ore. Excellent work!"
1443,"協力可能な技術を持つ者は、至急現場に向かってくれたまえ！
続けて、乱重力に関する別件の報告だ。"
1444,This is not a drill! We call upon all personnel with the requisite skill sets to respond immediately!
